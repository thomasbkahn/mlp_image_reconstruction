# MLP Image Reconstruction

Application of concepts from the [Fourier Features](https://bmild.github.io/fourfeat/index.html) paper,
but oriented towards making cool representations of photographs rather than high-fidelity representation.

## How to use

(This is still in a pretty rough state)

- `train.py` is a training script, modify the arguments there and run it.
- `reconstruct.py` will iterate through a directory and produce rendered output for every checkpoint it finds
