- try fourier encoding (basic form from paper / repo, just 2 / a few encoding features)
	- especially with interpolation - this might be interesting
- basic encoding =

```
bvals = np.eye(2)
avals = np.ones((bvals.shape[0])) 
```


- try dropout
- try other feature encoding (non-periodic)
- try other color space targets

- learning rate scheduling
- leaky relu

# Github
- add example results / animations
